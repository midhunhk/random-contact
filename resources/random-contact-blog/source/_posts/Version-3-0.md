Version 3.0 codenamed 'hypercube' is available in the Google Play Store now.

Hypercube is a random word used as code name for this release.
The following changes are part of this release.

 - Migration to Android Studio and Gradle based project
 - Custom groups for generating random contacts.
 - New App Icon and Image Resources

<img alt="Random Contact" src="/images/contact-groups.png" width="300" />

Custom Groups for generating Random Contact is a frequently requested feature, but since the AeAppsLib 
was migrated to Android Studio, this project also needed to be updated to Gradle Android build system.
This was causing the delay for this release.

A minor coat of paint is applied as we have a new icon.
