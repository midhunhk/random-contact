### Redesigned and Rewritten
The app has been completely redesigned and rewritten from scratch. Lot of best practices have been followed both in terms of UX as well as Android development. 

In-App Reviews and Update flows have been integrated as well.

### Improved Contact Picker
One of the main user requests have been to improve the contact picker as well as enable edit of a contarct group. 
The problem was there was a change required in the underlying library `lib-AeApps` to enable this. And it was in the middle of a year long 
restructing. Once that was taken care, it was easy to update the framework and apply these changes.

### Dark Mode
One of the advantage of upgrading to the latest kotlin and material design libraries is the improved support for Themes and Dark mode. 
It was seamless to implement and test.
